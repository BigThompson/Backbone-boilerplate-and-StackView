=================================
current version: 0.5.1

A Boilerplate "real" application based on Backbone.js and powered by StackView
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Working Demo: https://secure.digitalsignage.com/boilerplate/public/index.html

The application is a great way to get up and running quickly with everything one needs for a Single Page Application (SPA).
It takes care of authentication, language selection, SPA views, properties box, popup dialog, popup messages and more.

Best of all, the app is powered by StackView which allows you a simple yet effective way to switch between Backbone views.
With StackView you have the power to switch between sliders, popups and Fade Views using smooth animation.
And the great thing is that you don't have to jump through loops, simply create a simple Backbone view and add it to StackView.

The sample application takes advantage of the following technologies:

 - StackView
 - Backbone
 - jQuery
 - Cookie
 - Bootstrap
 - Localizer
 - Bootbox
 - LocalStorage
 - and a bit more synthetic sugar

Installation:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Simply clone the project, expand to a web server under the directory of: boilerplate/public/[DATA HERE]' and point your browser to index.html file.
If you to change path, be sure to modify init.js startup file.
